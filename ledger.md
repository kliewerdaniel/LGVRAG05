## Implementation Notes

### Key Features Implemented
- **Multi-format document support**: PDF, Markdown, plain text
- **Local LLM integration**: Ollama with configurable models
- **Flexible embedding models**: SentenceTransformers with model switching
- **Hybrid retrieval**: Combines semantic similarity with graph relationships
- **Scalable architecture**: Modular design for easy extension
- **Local-only operation**: No external API dependencies

### Technical Decisions
- Used Pydantic for data validation and configuration
- Implemented async/await for better performance
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Used type hints throughout for better code quality

### Challenges Resolved
- Integrated multiple document parsing libraries
- Handled different text encodings and formats
- Optimized embedding generation for large documents
- Implemented efficient graph traversal algorithms

## Current Status
✅ **PROJECT COMPLETE** - All modules implemented and tested

## Next Steps
- [ ] Performance optimization
